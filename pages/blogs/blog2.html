                        For someone who has struggled to accept how beautiful or how pretty they look, let me tell you, it makes sense now because I am fighting my own demons. I remember this became my reality when I was in primary school, Class 4, when we got into a fight with this girl.
                         We were quarrelling over something, not sure what but it led her to say,
                         “You are as ugly as the devil.” I know it may sound silly but those words pierced more than just my heart. We obviously had to reconcile because it became a big issue. It’s been 10 years now and those words pierce me every time. 
                        <br>Last year, when I joined University, I remember people commenting in the group this particular Friday afternoon during class. One person decided to make a comment about how I looked, specifically my feet. He said, “Miguu za Tess zinakaa ya Grealish.” When I googled this my jaw dropped. 
                        Have you ever felt everyone’s eyes turn to you and start laughing. From the comments people added in the group chat to the whispers. I stopped wearing dresses especially 
                        when I knew I would bump into anyone who was in that group chat. I went into the weekend so devastated. I was lost for a long time during that period. I distance myself from everything. 
                        I was breaking into pieces. I could not only feel the pain but also see the pain. Well, he apologized for it after I confronted him but the damage was already done. I was already broken inside. I tried to get myself back on my feet. Pep talk it is.  
                    </p>
                    <div class="post__content">
                        <div class="post__content__text">
                            <p>In CRE classes in primary, Our teacher taught us this verse, You are beautifully and wonderfully made in the image and likeness of God. It took me a whole lot of years to believe these words even though it’s written in the bible. 
                                I would repeat them but still look clueless. 
                                <br>I lost the spark that made me happy. The small thing that would make me light up. That spark that my dimples would catch people’s attention. In class 2, My art teacher asked me, “Megan, can you enlighten us with your smile?” So, I did. He took a coin and compared it then said,”
                                 Your dimple is so deep I can bury this coin inside.” I was so happy.  </p><br>
                                <p>When I joined high school that joy and the dimple my teacher described was not there. Sometimes, I say it disappeared and only appeared when I smiled from ear to ear. This was until I asked myself this question, “what feature in your body is your most favorite?” There it was, my smile and my old self back for a moment.
                                     My smile came back after this true happiness indeed. I have maintained that happy self until date. 
                                    <br>All these scenarios made me question how to dress and how I am supposed to look. There is a point where I refused to compliment people for how pretty or cute or beautiful they look. I could not bring myself to. Why would I? Sometimes or let’s say most times I wanted to be complimented in order to feel that pretty. I don’t like the love language words of affirmation. I am not sure if telling your significant other that they look good or beautiful or pretty is part of it but to me it seems so. I don’t think that just because I sent you a photo gives you the opportunity to make these compliments because there is no other comment. Lack of genuineness. Like that’s the only thing there is to say.
                                     I’ve also never liked it when someone says it all the time like so frequently that it becomes a song. To me that is all lies. </p>
                                    <p>I keep remembering things I did to try and make myself feel whole again. Most times I cried for the FEARLESS inner child to find me because she was who she was before the world broke her into pieces. 10 YEARS down the line I finally understand the verse that I am beautifully and wonderfully made in the image and likeness of God. (Psalms 139: 14). 10 YEARS that inner child has broken the prison walls of how she looks. 10 YEARS I accepted who I am for myself. 10 YEARS I can touch myself; my hair, my face, my skin, my hands, my legs and feel satisfied. No more 10 years of living in the version of people about myself. I’m absolutely overjoyed. I can express myself to people how I look and how I feel. I hope no one gets to feel lost because of how they have been made to feel. I hope no one gets to feel less of themselves or that they are not enough.
                                         I hope no one gets to be told how they are supposed to look. I hope someone gets to feel whole after this.

                        <p>Perfection is an illusion. It’s through our cracks that light and growth emerge. By embracing our flaws and letting go of unrealistic expectations, we find beauty, 
                            peace, and connection in our imperfect selves. Life isn’t about perfection—it’s about being real.</p>
